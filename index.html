Our personalities describe who we are? they're our ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. To me, personality is very important, because it describes my whole behaviour in front of others.In my opinion,"the first impression is the last impression" is the most important aspect of personality when you meet with other people.</p>

When I solve someone's problems and help them, I feel happy and proud about myself. Helping someone and being blessed by them is how I view my life as successful. Helping someone and fulfilling their need is very exciting for me, and I also want to see the joy it brings to them afterwards.</p>

                    <P class="text-gray">As much as possible, I wish to travel in India and also outside the country. I want to experience the unique culture and environment of different places as well as their lifestyles. The best thing I like in the period of traveling is to walk a long way and climb a mountain. My perspective is that everyone should travel at least once a year during their lifetime. Take time off from your busy life to travel and enjoy yourself.</P>

                    <P class="text-gray">Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the use of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. When I come up with frustration, I always listen to some music after that I feel much better. It means that music is a real friend to me when I am in difficult situations. I have found that music is the best partner in every situation  to boost my mood. Music is my passion.</P>
